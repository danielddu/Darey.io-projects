# Git Project Implementation

In this project, i will be implementing some basic linux commands, cloning repository, staging, commiting and pushing changes. Also, I will be doing some pull request and merge. 

I created files for the webpages for greenwood library website and included random content.

* home
* about_us
* events
* contact_us


These html files were created using `touch` command.

Content was added into each file using `echo` command with `>>`

![home](./img/1.home%20file.png)

![about_us](./img/2.about_us.png)

![events](./img/3.events.png)

![contact_us](./img/4.contact_us.png)
